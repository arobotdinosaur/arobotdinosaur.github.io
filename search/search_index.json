This was because the batteries were providing power ranging from 4V to 5V. We had two power rails: An unregulated power rail (called VBAT) that provides power to the motors and input of the voltage regulator and is driven directly by the battery, and a regulated supply driven by the voltage regulator (called 3V) </p> <p>A netbridge was also created in order to electrically connect two nets in a schematic while keeping the nets separate in schematic .

The placement of some components were extremely important- for example, the antenna had to be placed near the edge of the board for uninterrupted communication, and the IMU had to be placed at the centre for accurate measurements. The crystal was placed close to the microcontroller, and the motor controllers were placed at the edges of the board. </p> <p>We primarily used the autorouter to route all wirings and connections, except in the case of the antenna and parts of the microcontroller. The antenna had to be connected with a large wire (50 mm) manually to the balun and other components (such as the corresponding  microcontroller pins and capacitors). The crystal also had to manually routed with specific pins of the microcontroller. We utilized differential pairs for sending the signals from the antenna and crystal back to the microcontroller due to the sensitivity of these components.</p> <p>The board had to fit under a 13.9 cm square requirement  with motor holes of 12.2 mm for optimal placement.  In Fusion 360, the board was aligned to a 1 mm grid for aesthetic reasons. </p> <p>We had four layers on the board in order to manage all the wirings and connections succinctly. We had a top layer, bottom layer, and two internal layers (one for 3V/VBAT and the other for GND/BAT_GND). The top and bottom layers involved signal routing for connecting various electronic components. The bottom plan was used whenever possible to reduce electrical noise. The 3V/VBAT and GND/BAT_GND layers were exclusively used for delivering power and ground signals, respectively. The traces that carried both power and ground signals were as short as possible to provide a low-resistance path for current to flow.  We took care to leave a gap in all the layers beneath the IMU as the manufacture specified that we should not have metal underneath it for best performance.</p> <p>Image of the connected boards in Fusion 360.  </p>"},{"location":"quadcopter/#sensor-filtering-and-calibration","title":"Sensor Filtering and Calibration","text":"<p>Prior to reading data from the IMU, we had to establish a connection between a test remote and the FCB; we accomplished this using a check-sum that would transmit data sent from the remote (such as throttle value, pitch, roll, yaw) to the FCB. In addition, we also wrote code that read the existing gimbal value from the remote and transmitted it to the FCB to achieve flight.  The check-sum was created in order to prevent bad data packets from getting sent over and to only accept packets that were sent from our remote (and not from other groups). </p> <p>On the FCB, we had to read data from the IMU to accurately measure the orientation. We used an existing library corresponding to the IMU called Adafruit_AHRS- from this, we used the <code>Adafruit_Simple_AHRS::getQuadOrientation()</code> function to gather all the necessary data. We obtained the pitch rate, roll, and yaw from the quad orientation function. After gathering these data from the IMU, we created a complementary filter to filter out some of the noise created by the accelerometer and gyroscope. The accelerometer (Euler angles of the orientation) and gyroscope readings (the angular accelerations) were taken from the IMU.  The reason we created a complementary filter was to gather the best possible data from both the gyroscope and the accelerometer as each inertial sensor has positives and drawbacks. The accelerometers do not drift over time, but they are quite noisy when the motors are running, and slightly less responsive compared to the gyroscope. Whereas, gyroscopes are less noisy than  the accelerometers, but the resulting measurement will drift over time due to accumulated error. We tried to set a high gain such that we could extract more data from the gyroscope in our code.  We used a standard formula shown below with a gain of 0.98- <code>cf_angle = (gain) * (cf_angle + (gyro_raw * RAD_TO_DEG * dt)) + (1-gain) * (acc_angle)</code></p> <p><code>RAD_TO_DEG = 57.295779513082320876798154814105</code> <code>cf_angle</code> is the angle resulted from the complementary  filter, <code>gyro_raw</code> is the gyroscope measurement, <code>acc_angle</code> is the Euler angles, <code>dt</code> is the change in time from the measurements.  </p> <p>We also accounted for any offsets caused by the IMU in the code to have it read zero when levelled.  We only performed complementary filtering on the roll and pitch axes. </p>"},{"location":"quadcopter/#pid-control-and-tuning","title":"PID Control and Tuning","text":"<p>PID is a type of controller used in feedback systems to regulate speed, position, and various other parameters to ensure stability. We used PID to keep the FCB stable and levelled when the motors were running.  Proportional (P) responds to the current error and provides immediate action  Integral (I) accumulates past errors  Derivative (D) predicts future errors based on the rate of change.  This was implemented for the pitch and roll axes using the following equation-  <code>PID = (Kp* error) + Ki* integral - Kd* derivative</code>  Where <code>Kp, Ki, Kd</code> are constants that are determined by testing, <code>error</code> is the difference from the remote gimbal input and the offset of the axis (<code>error = setpoint - corrected</code>), <code>integral</code> is <code>integral = error* dt+integral</code> , and derivative is the raw gyro readings in degrees. We used the raw gyro readings rather than doing a numerical derivative of cf_pitch because the raw gyroscope readings had slightly less delay. </p> <p>PID for yaw rate was implemented a bit differently. The control was only proportional to on the velocity error in yaw, which we got directly from the raw gyroscope yaw data.</p> <p>After writing the code for all three axes control, we combined them so that there would be an equal output to the motors. We implemented a mixing function which increased the power for the front motors and decreased the power for the rear motors based on the PID output.</p> <p>Through trial and error, we were able to find the optimal <code>Kp, Ki, Kd</code> values for the various axes to achieve stability. For pitch and roll: a \u2018P\u2019 overshoot would have resulted in the FCB \u201csway\u201d from one end to another, an \u2018I\u2019 overshoot would have resulted in levelling at an odd angle, and a \u2018D\u2019 overshoot would have resulted in the FCB oscillating rapidly. Undershoots of each would have resulted in the quad not being able to move at all. For yaw rate, overshoots of \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 resulted in the FCB spinning uncontrollably in space, whereas undershoots would have not caused any motion. </p> <p>One critical factor for having reliable PID control was having a fast control loop running on the microcontroller. We initially had issues with \"derivative kick\" where the derivative term was causing unstable behavior due to a high control latency. To optimize speed, we made sure that only critical processes were running. Once we commented out all the print statements that we'd been using for debugging, the loop time reduced from about 35 ms to only 8 ms, and our PID controller ran much better.</p> <p>For determining the yaw rate coefficients, our control was proportional to the yaw rate error (thus we did not have a <code>Kd</code> value after testing).  </p> <p>This is a video of the PID demonstration for the pitch axis </p>"},{"location":"quadcopter/#pcb-assembly","title":"PCB Assembly","text":"<p>After our PCB quadcopter boards were manufactured, we started on the assembly portion of the board. We applied solder paste to our boards using a stencil (a thin aluminium sheet with precise holes corresponding to the board). Immediately after, we attached all the necessary electronic components by hand, ensuring accuracy and precision. We later used a reflow oven to connect the components and the PCB pads as a reflow oven guarantees a secure connections between the paste applied to the PCB pads and the attached components. </p> <p>Picture of assembly after reflow (note that some components were missing due to unavailability at the time of assembly)  </p>"},{"location":"quadcopter/#flight","title":"Flight","text":"<p>We demonstrated flight using the provided FCB. </p> <p>Flight was broken into the following categories-  1. \"Roombaing\" -- moving around the the floor with dowels installed with direction control and minimal yaw 2.
